# PDFtoText
Python-3 based program to convert pdf to text files. Still needs some work to make it work more constantly. 

##When asked for output folder, this actually means a cache folder. 

##You will have to update the directories in the source code for now, as they are hardcoded. 


Requirements:
#PyTesseract
#pdf2image
#PIL
